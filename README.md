# capybara_game_

Hi guys! I've been wanting to make a game for a while! One that features a cute capybara :)! Here is how I made it:

I first followed Estella's tutorial & added a charcter + Tile maps. I got the charcter pictures and tiles off the internet!

I also added the background(as an image) and made it be behind the other objects! 
It's a picture of the sky with 2 clouds!

Ok so afterwards I decided to add fruits that the capybara can collect. I created a canvaslayer and to that I added a label(the number of fruit they collected) and a textureRect with a picture of the fruit. I created 4 scripts for this: event_controller, game_controller, fruit, and fruit_ui. These 3 scrips work together so that when the capybara bumps into the fruit, it sends a signal that tells the label to increase.

I finished everything off by adding background music. I just added this as an audioStreamPlayer with autoplay on my main screen.
